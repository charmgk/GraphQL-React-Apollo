        <p>Isn't that fantastic that you can make whole mountains in minutes? What the devil. Get tough with it, get strong. Everybody's different. Trees are different. Let them all be individuals.</p>
        <p>It's important to me that you're happy. Talk to trees, look at the birds. Whatever it takes. Life is too short to be alone, too precious. Share it with a friend. We need dark in order to show light.</p>
        <p>This present moment is perfect simply due to the fact you're experiencing it. The more we do this - the more it will do good things to our heart. We don't want to set these clouds on fire.</p>
